# Ireland Energy Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Ireland’s energy system over the last 20 years. This project explores the country’s energy mix, efficiency, sectoral consumption, and energy trade, providing insights for sustainability, innovation, and a greener future.

## 💡 Inspiration

Ireland’s energy transition is one of Europe’s most ambitious. I was inspired by the challenge of visualizing how the country balances fossil fuels and renewables, while identifying opportunities for efficiency, innovation, and sustainability.

---

## ⚡️ What it does

* **Energy Mix:** Shows the evolution of fossil fuels vs. renewable sources.
* **Efficiency & Losses:** Highlights where energy is lost across the system.
* **Consumption by Sector:** Breaks down energy use in transport, residential, and industry.
* **Energy Trade:** Reveals Ireland’s dependence on energy imports and trade dynamics.

---

## 🚀 How we built it

* Collected historical energy data from SEAI and other open sources.
* Cleaned and structured the data using Excel, CSVs, and SQL.
* Performed additional data analysis with Python (Pandas, NumPy).
* Built interactive dashboards in Tableau with filters, trends, and clear visual storytelling.

---

## 🛠 Challenges we ran into

* Finding consistent and reliable data across multiple years.
* Designing dashboards that balance technical detail with accessibility.
* Highlighting efficiency and losses clearly for non-expert users.

---

## ⭐️ Accomplishments I am proud of

* Created a clear, interactive tool to track Ireland’s energy efficiency and sustainability.
* Highlighted progress in reducing fossil fuel dependency and improving efficiency.
* Produced a resource that supports decision-making for policymakers, companies, and communities.

## 🔍 What we learned

* How to turn complex energy data into actionable, visual insights.
* The importance of monitoring efficiency and losses in shaping a sustainable energy system.
* Advanced Tableau techniques for interactive dashboards and storytelling.

---

## ⏳ What we’d do with more time

* Integrate **real-time energy data** for live monitoring.
* Add **predictive analytics** for 2030 and 2050 carbon-neutral targets.
* Include AI/ML models to forecast trends and optimize energy efficiency.
* Compare Ireland’s energy transition with other EU countries.
